	    </Configuration>
	    
	    
	This is an example of the format needed to use Attributr. 

2. #### Code usage

		Attributr.openLicenseActivity(getActivity(),
                            "Some activity title",
                            R.raw.license_config,
                            R.drawable.ic_action_launcher,
                            R.style.Theme_Custom);

	Just call this to launch the attribution license activity to display your previous configuration in a beautiful card format.
	
3. #### Customization

	Just call ````Attributr.parseConfiguration(ctx, R.raw.license_config);```` to get a list of ````Library```` objects to use in your own manner. This way you can create your own Adapter to use in whatever view model you wish to display.


## Planned Features

*	Easier 'License' configuration
	* 	Specifying a license type via attribute (i.e. ````type="apache2|mit|gplv3|etc..."````) and supply the appropriate information to place into the template license string.
	
*	Style configurations
	*   Supply the developer with a configuration class that they can use to customize the styling of the license card views and list.
